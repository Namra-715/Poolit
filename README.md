# Prototype Demo


# Inspiration
The inspiration behind Pool It was to address the transportation and package delivery challenges faced by UC Davis students, specifically during weekend trips to visit family. The goal was to create a convenient and efficient all-in-one platform that facilitates Ridesharing and package delivery within the student community. By addressing transportation, environment and delivery challenges while incorporating sustainable practices and promoting community engagement, Pool It strives to make a positive impact.

# What it does:
Pool It is a mobile app developed using Flutter that allows UC Davis students to easily connect and rideshare with fellow students or family members traveling from the university. It also provides a feature for delivering small packages among the student community. The app aims to simplify the process of coordinating rideshares and package deliveries, enhancing convenience for students.

# How we built it:
We first started prototyping it on FIGMA, then we built it as a mobile app using the Flutter framework. We used our skills in Flutter development, along with various libraries and tools, to create the user interface and implement the necessary features. The development process involved designing intuitive navigation and ensuring a smooth user experience that matched the design prototypes.

# Challenges we ran into:
During the hackathon, we encountered a lot of challenges with Flutter development and making progress on the app's functionality. Overcoming these challenges required troubleshooting technical issues, understanding the nuances of Flutter, and finding effective solutions to keep the project on track. We wasted a lot of time trying to get the basics to work, for instance we made it work with mongo db but then changed it last minute to firebase. We definitely couldn't finish the whole project in time.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of:
The team is proud to have developed a functional mobile app using Flutter that addresses the specific transportation and package delivery needs of UC Davis students. Achieving a user-friendly interface and navigation system were significant accomplishments. Additionally, providing a platform that fosters connections and convenience among students is a source of pride. We came into the competition without any knowledge on how we will be doing this, but we made it this far.

# What we learned:
Developing Pool It using Flutter provided the team with valuable experience in mobile app development and working with cross-platform frameworks. We gained knowledge in navigating the challenges of Flutter, overcoming technical hurdles, and creating an accessible and intuitive app interface. Additionally, we learned about the importance of effective communication and collaboration in a hackathon setting.

# What's next for Pool It:
Moving forward, the team plans to further enhance Pool It based on user feedback and insights gained during the hackathon. We aim to refine the app's navigation system to make it even more intuitive and user-friendly. Additionally, expanding the app's features and functionality, such as integrating additional services or introducing new capabilities, are part of the future plans for Pool It. For example Advanced Ride Matching: Implementing an intelligent algorithm to enhance the ride matching process, taking into account factors such as preferred departure times, trip distances, and passenger preferences. Safety Features & Social Community Features are also great ideas in mind for our future.
